This couple of days been busy setting a wiki site.  I've successfully installed <a href=http://kwiki.org/>kwiki</a> on my personal site before. But this time, failed to install it with a /blah/public_html/ environment. And then tried <a href=http://moin.sf.net/>moinmoinwiki</a>, which, imho, is too complex..oh..well too annoying to set up. Python things.. i dont like them much... Whenever possible i'd choose perl stuff first. 

The perl wiki cant be installed and the python wiki aint my style. So i run to <a href=phpwiki.sf.net>phpwiki</a>. Installation is very smooth. Just extract the tarball and then it works 'out of box'. (That's mostly due to the php's nature: embedded in html).

Spent a while on tweaking it, ie. configurations, charset, theme, favorite icon, logo, etc. And now it spins pretty well. =)

P.S. appreciated again the powerful yet elegant UN*X command line tools, when doing those icon/logo stuff.  <a href=http://www.imagemagick.org/>ImageMagick</a> suite (convert, composite, etc.) just rox!
