Have read some chapters of the Chinese version before.  Occasionally found the <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066620732/ref=lpr_g_2/102-6214124-1092150?v=glance&s=books>original English version</a> in a local bookstore. Spent about 2 hours there reading it.

What interests me most are the days before, of, and rite after Linus creating his start-as-a-hobby-but-end-up-being-a-powerful operating system. Totally a geek, being very nerdy. His first PC, his college life, the army service, the days & nights toying with Minix, first step of writing Linux, the debate with <a href=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html>Andrew</a>. Other parts of how he met with Steve Jobs, Bill Joy are all very interesting.

Nice reading. And i like that funny writing way. =) The young Linus' enthusiasm just gives me some kind of encouragement (and passion?) for coding/programming/hacking. 

Keep going! :^)
