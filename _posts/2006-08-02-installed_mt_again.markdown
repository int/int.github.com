40 has been back again for a while.  My old MT blogs have been lost^Wrecovered (see [this blog entry](http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/mtblog/2006/08/old_blog_entries_successfully_recovered.html)). Now that i've got more convenient net connections, i dont need [nanoblogger](http://nanoblogger.sf.net) any more (at least for some time). So blog^WMT-time again! 

Though fire now provides a [multiuser WP blog](http://blog.linuxfire.com.cn),  i, after trying it out, dont like WP still.  MT is (to me) more powerful and the functionalities are more needed. And yes, it just behaves the way i much prefer.

MT 3.31 has many improvements including new (simplified) config/installation with several plugins (ie. for style and antispam) builtin by default.  If you havent used MT or your MT is outdated, i highly recommend you give it a (new) whirl. 

About the config, i just changed the MT file mask settings (default is world-writable). As for the plugin, i installed the sweet [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown/) plugin (as always, be it for nano, WP, or MT =). Now both the entry and the comments are handled by Markdown.

Keep going. Hope i can write more stuff.
