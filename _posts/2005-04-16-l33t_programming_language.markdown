Speaking l33t is not kool anymore. Time for l33t programming.

Accasionally, i saw <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L33t_programming_language>this interesting stuff</a> on wikipedia. Never thought l33t could become a programming language, ever.

After playing a while with an interpreter <a href=http://electrod.ifreepages.com/l33t.zip>written in Python</a> as well as one <a href=http://propellors.net/files/l33t.rb>written in Ruby</a>, i decided to write a l33t interpreter in C.

Coding, debuging and some bug fixing, finally come up with a complete l33t interpreter with CON (socket) support.

Here's <a href=http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/code/l33t.c>the code</a>. Enjoy. 

Well, there're not too many l33t programs available yet. It's fun to write one yourself and then play it with my interpreter. :p




btw, firefox has a bookmark keyword feature, which is pretty good and thus enables you with quick search (duh?!).  Try typing 'wp l33t programming language' in your location bar. Oh..i edited that page. :^)
