Google gadgets are now [available for linux](http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/).  

[Compiled](http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/wiki/FAQ) and [ran](http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/pics/google-gadgets-for-linux.png) it on hardy [1]. You might also refer to the [QuickStart](http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/wiki/QuickStart) and [HowtoBuild](http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/wiki/HowToBuild).

[1] Yes, as you can see, at the time of [last entry](http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/mtblog/2007/08/go_gutsy.html), i was using gutsy and only one entry later, i'm now using hardy!  Is ubuntu released too fast or am i just too lazy to update my blog..

BUT stay tuned, my "lucky" few (<5 if me not counted, i guess) rss subscribers. I'll write more and often. I promise you. BUT as the following quote says,
