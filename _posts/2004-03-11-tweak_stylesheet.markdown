..to fit in IE...

Happened to find that the calendar cannot be properly displayed within ie. Cost me pretty a while to figure it out.  After checking/trying out <a href=http://www.movabletype.org/default_styles.shtml>all default styles</a> that MT provided, just changed one thing in the Trendy css: .calendar padding 5px --> 2px.

Now okay in ie...

So it made all this impression much stronger: ie really sux.   oh..yes, so does windoze, or maybe any/everything that's from M$?
