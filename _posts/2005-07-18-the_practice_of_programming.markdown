This book was baught quite long ago. But i didnt have enough time/chance/whatever to read it all [for a reason or two]. Just finished reading the whole book today. All i can say is.. a must-buy and a must-read.

<a href=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/>Brian W. Kernighan</a> always writes great books. <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131103628/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-6937209-8857507?v=glance&s=books>The K&R C</a>, <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0131103628/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-6937209-8857507?v=glance&s=books>The UN*X Programming Environment</a>, etc.  The Practice of Programming is no exception. The authors (Brain & <a href=http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/rob/>Rob</a>) lead you thourgh every areas of programming: ie. style, design, coding, interface, debugging, test, performance, portability.  The famous UN*X guys give you very kool tips & tricks from their own (wonderful) experiences. 

I recommend you read every word of this book, which would eases your daily coding life pretty pretty much.  You will become more productive and you'll definitely avoid otherwise stupid and/or obscure mistakes.  

Beside the their insightful words, the code snippet provided is awesome.  You will see how gurus write clean & elegant code in a clear and reasonable way. Here are three programs adopted from the book:

1) A <a href=http://linuxfire.dhis.org/~alecs/code/markov.c>Markov-chain</a> that makes you produce beautiful but nonsense text.
2)  A <a href=http://linuxfire.dhis.org/~alecs/code/csv.c>csv</a> (comma-seperated values) parser.
3). A simple <a href=http://linuxfire.dhis.org/~alecs/code/grep.c>grep</a> that supports '^', '$', '.', '*'.
