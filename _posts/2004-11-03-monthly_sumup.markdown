Our team has successfully submitted 140 correct solutions to <a href=http://acm.zju.edu.cn/>acm</a>, of which i myself contributed 100+ ones. =)

By working on these acm problems, i learned some new algos/techniques while being more familiar with some old algo/DS.

Effort should be continued in the next month and hopefully submit more acms.

P.S. The book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0262032937/103-0107820-1424632?v=glance><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></a> is such an invaluable resource that you simply cannot avoid reading it. Here is an <a href=http://acm.ustc.edu.cn/book.php>online version of this book</a> (But i _highly_ recommend that you buy the hardcopy. Bet you will never regret for it). Along with the book, here are <a href=http://acm.ustc.edu.cn/~daizisheng/mp3/video/Introduction_To_Algorithm/>MIT videos</a> of algo lessons. Enjoy.
