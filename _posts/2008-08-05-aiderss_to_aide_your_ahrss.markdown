> I dont digg, i reddit.

Information-exploding century.  Tens of feeds.  Hundreds of entries.  You might have wasted too much time on reading blog/rss/feeds.

Normally, the more feeds you subscribe to, the less percentage of useful entries.   I read [proggit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) and [YC](http://news.ycombinator.com/) everyday. There are hundreds of updates everyday but only very few is interesting to me. The truth is, what remains interesting is really nice.  So i dont want to miss those interesting ones while i dont want to waste my time doing the manual filtering either.

So here comes a great tool called [aiderss](http://www.aiderss.com/) to help you easily locate those 'good' ones without wasting your (precious) time.  It adopts a technique called [PostRank](http://postrank.com/) to score/rank a post. Take proggit for example, you can see [all](http://www.aiderss.com/all/www.reddit.com/r/programming/), [good](http://www.aiderss.com/good/reddit.com/r/programming), [great](http://www.aiderss.com/great/reddit.com/r/programming) and [best](http://www.aiderss.com/best/reddit.com/r/programming) ones all filtered for you.  There are respective rss feeds made for you too. And if you use firefox + google reader, there's also an [addon](http://gr.aiderss.com/).

Oh, lets see [Alecs' Blog in the postranked mode](http://www.postrank.com/feed/fae6f2b9247196fe3b828ae0ef823f6d).
