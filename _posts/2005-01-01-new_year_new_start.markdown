Did a full-system upgrade for my fbsd box.

kernel (make build/installkernel), base (make build/installworld), and ports (via <a href=http://www.redantigua.com/portupgrade.html>portupgrade</a>) are all successfully upgrated.

Other news is about downloading tools:

Once-my-favorite <a href=http://prozilla.genesys.ro/>prozilla</a> has been found <a href=http://www.vuxml.org/freebsd/1a32e8ee-3edb-11d9-8699-00065be4b5b6.html>buffer overflow bug(s)</a>. Considering it hasnt been updated for 2 years, the fbsd team has decided to <a href=http://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/htdig/freebsd-ports/2004-December/018924.html>remove it out of the ports</a>. I just had to let it go.

Then i tried out: <a href=http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo/> Downloader for X</a>. Not bad. Multithreaded, gtk2, drag-and-drop, etc. It even has a basket which feels quite like flashget for M$.

I also installed the <a href=http://www.flashgot.net/whats>flashgot</a> extension for firefox. Works smoothly with the d4x. =)

P.S., similar tools of the command line :

1) for http, <a href=http://www.enderunix.org/aget/>Aget</a>
2) for ftp, well, the famous (no?!) <a href=http://lftp.yar.ru/>lftp</a>.
