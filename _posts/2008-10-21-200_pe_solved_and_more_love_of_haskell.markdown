Solving [project euler](http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/blog/2008/06/project-euler.html) problems continued to be fun.  Now i have solved [200 out of 213 problems](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=scores&level=5).  There have been some relatively easier ones recently added as well as some hard-and-fun ones.  Just to name a few:

*  [laser beam reflecting on mirrors](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=202)
* [paranoid flea jumping on a chess board](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=213)
* [secret ambiguous numbers](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=198)

And as always, i like to use [haskell](http://haskell.org) to solve them if possible.  And the more you use haskell the more you love it.  Here are some (new) haskell resources:

*  [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), great tutorial, very enjoyable.
*  [Real World Haskell](http://realworldhaskell.org/), soon to be published by O'Reilly.

Two search engines for haskell (API, library, types, etc.):

* [Hoogle](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/), Haskell's Google
* [Hayoo!](http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html), Haskell's Yahoo! 2.0
