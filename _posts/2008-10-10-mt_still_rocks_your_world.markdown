Export old entries from mt3, install brand new [MT4](http://movabletype.org/), and import back.  Sweet. Smooth. Slick. 

MT4 has markdown builtin by default so all my entries are rendered with no problem at all.  The new interface is modern and user-friendly, yet still quick and powerful.  Time to dig out more and hopefully to write more.

> It just works.
