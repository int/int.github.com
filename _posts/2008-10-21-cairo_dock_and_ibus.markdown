I've been using [awn](http://linuxfire.com.cn/~alecs/blog/2007/04/avant-and-screenlets.html) for quite a while.  It's normally ok but sometimes it just has one glitch or another: not very stable.  Also the feel is not quite like Mac's Dock.  Now here's a new one: [Cairo Dock](http://www.cairo-dock.org/).  It looks great and feels snappy. The icon magnification is just neat.

And for the input method, i got fed up with scim and its crappy dict.  Now i start using [ibus](http://code.google.com/p/ibus). It's written by the same author of [scim-python](http://code.google.com/p/scim-python).  It looks very promising (Dbus based, native theme, etc.) and hopefully has a bright future (i guess).  You can give it a try.
