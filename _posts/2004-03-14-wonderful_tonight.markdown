<i>by Eric Clapton</i>

it's late in the evening
she's wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her make up
and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me
do i look alright
and i say yes
you look wonderful tonight
we go to a party
and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady
is walking around with me
and then she asks me
do you feel alright
and i say yes
i feel wonderful tonight

i feel wonderful
because i see the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just don't realize how much i love you

it's time to go home now
and i've got an aching head
so i give her the car keys
and she helps me into bed
and then i tell her
as i turn out the light
i say my darling
you were wonderful tonight
