Everybody writes his own SCM these days.  

Here's 'yet another' one: <a href=http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>mercurial</a>, which is also called hg, the chemical symbol for mercury.

In the first glance it's quite like git. But it's more lite-weight, of less sized repo, with http builtin, full pull/merge/push support, etc. And it's written in python, which results in small codebase.

Read <a href=http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/README>this doc</a> for basic usage (feels home if you're familiar with other SCM tools anyway).

I'm now using it to follow <a href=http://www.kernel.org/hg/>Linus' tree</a> and the <a href=http://selenic.com/hg>mercurial itself</a>.  Works fine.  Not bad. =)
