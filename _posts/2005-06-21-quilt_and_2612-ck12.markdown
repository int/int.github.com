<a href=http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.12/2.6.12-ck1/>2.6.12-ck1</a>, the <a href=http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6/2.6.12/baby_cigar.JPG>'Baby Cigar'</a>, was out so i just tried it out. But it failed to compile:

UP uses SMP-only stuff.  It's easy to fix. A very trivial bug. I think Con might have been too happy/busy having a new baby that he has overlooked this. =)

We can simply add some #ifdef to comment out SMP code for UP. I dont want to mess this trivial fix patch with the 'official' ck patch so i use the <a href=http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt>quilt tool</a>.

Simply put, quilt is a patch managing tool derived from Andrew Monton's <a href=http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/>patch scripts</a>. It eases all the patch push/pop work in the process of developing/debugging/fixing/reverting. 

Now, back to our case, we create our fix by the following command, 

$ quilt new trivialfixsmp.diff

and then edit the file kernel/sched.c to add make some #ifdef,

$ quilt edit kernel/sched.c  

and then we refrsesh the patch,

$ quilt refresh

and you'll see the patch at patches/trivialfixsmp.diff

Yeah, i made my patch, compiled the kernel, and found that Con noticed the issue too. And he soon (very soon, if you dont mind) released the ck2. And i found that Con's patch's a little bit different from mine (different patches to do the same thing, anyway). So to use the 'official' fix patch from ck2, we can first remove our patch,

$ quilt pop
$ quilt delete trivialfixsmp.diff

and then import Con's patch for this

$ quilt import sched-fix_up_build.patch

and finally apply it,

$ quilt push


Quilt neat. =)
